        <hr align="left">
        <h1>My Story</h1>
            <p>I'm Kaylie Woods, and I'm a visual storyteller. I tell stories through graphic and web design and photography. 
               I graduated from Ball State University cum laude in 2018 with a bachelor of arts in journalism graphics and a minor 
               in digital publishing. My passion for design, photography, and storytelling goes back to my years in middle school 
               and high school as a member of the yearbook staff, and ultimately, the copy editor my junior year, and editor-in-chief 
               my senior year. The many hours I spent designing pages, writing copy, taking pictures, and editing are what 
               lead me to pursue visual storytelling.</p>

            <h4>Sweetwater Sound and the Sweet Family of Companies</h4>
                <p>I was a graphic design intern for Sweetwater Sound in the summer of 2016. During my time at Sweetwater, I worked on a variety of designs for both Sweetwater and the Sweet Family of Companies, which is the group of different companies that are owned by Sweetwater. I didn't just sit at a desk and design all day. Sweetwater's marketing department has its own print shop on site in which all print materials for all of the sweet companies are printed. I had the opportunity to work in the print shop and get hands-on experience bringing signage to life. I enjoyed getting this experience because printing is a major part of design and I know everything I learned in the print shop will aid me in the future.</p>

                <p>I also had the opportunity to get behind a camera lens and shoot some pictures. Carl Verheyen, a talented musician who has worked on several movies and was in the band Supertramp, recorded a solo album entirely at Sweetwater Studios. I photographed the event in which the documentary of this recording experience was premiered to the public. I also took pictures of the bands in the first week of Rock Camp, Sweetwater's summer workshop for kids and teens in which they form a band and record and play music, and my last day at Sweetwater, I photographed the fifth week Rock Camp concert.</p>
